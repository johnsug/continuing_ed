This repo hosts my continuing education log (ce_log.csv) and an R script (**TBD.R**) to make sure I am in compliance with the continuing education requirements set by the Society of Actuaries to maintain my ASA credential.

### Continuing Education Requirements [*](https://www.soa.org/leadership/current-initiatives/cpd-faqs-section-b.aspx)
* 60 units (50 hours) every two-years
  * one unit = 50 minutes
* 30 units must be in **structured education**
  * at least 7.5 units of **structured credit** must come from a source other than your employer
* 3 units of **professionalism** (must be in a structured setting)
* no more than 15 units of **business and management skills**

### Definitions
* **Business and Management Skills:** Business and management skills are the skills necessary for success because they improve your personal effectiveness and ability to succeed in a diverse business environment. They include business writing, speaking, people management, negotiation, influencing, project management and leadership skills. They're encouraged but not required in the CPD Requirement. The amount of business and management skills you should take depends on your job and your level of expertise in business skills. The maximum amount of the CPD Requirement that can be satisfied by business and management skills is 15 units per two-year cycle.

* **Job-Relevant:** These typically include both technical and non-technical topics. Examples of technical topics include actuarial, mathematical, modeling, legislative and regulatory, legal and other similar skills that are core to the work of actuaries and specific to your role or practice area. Job-relevant topics also include non-technical skills, particularly for those in management roles or aspiring toward management roles, including market and industry trends, business cycles and national and global economic issues. Job-relevant topics will vary from actuary to actuary based on the nature of your job, your area of practice, position and aspirations. For some actuaries, such as those in management roles, non-technical topics will make up the bulk of their job-relevant credit since these topics are critical to their role. For others, non-technical topics are important for future development but shouldn't comprise the bulk of CPD units they earn.

* **Professionalism:** Three units of professionalism must be earned in a structured setting every cycle. Because professionalism and professional standards are the foundation of actuarial practice, it's critical that all actuaries understand their application. Also, because there must be no misunderstanding about their application, it is important that professionalism units be earned in a structured setting rather than through self-study to allow actuaries to interact with and learn from each other regarding their application. Therefore, you must have at least three units of structured credit in professionalism during a two-year cycle. You are encouraged to earn more professionalism credit, either through structured or self-study settings. ([source](https://www.soa.org/leadership/current-initiatives/cpd-faqs-section-b.aspx#B4)). The Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOPs) and U.S. and Canadian Codes of Professional Conduct are cited as examples of professionalism topics. Section B4 also lists "other professionalism topics, such as ethics" in the definition. This is designed to allow a wide range of professionalism topics, including but not limited to ethical issues regarding: fiduciary responsibilities, corporate governance, discrimination in hiring/workplace, price-fixing/monopolistic practices, intellectual property rights, business intelligence and ethical standards/practices around the world.

* **Self Study:** Many activities count as self-study, with the only exception being normal work duties. Acceptable self-study activities include, but aren't limited to, reading actuarial literature, statutes or regulations; reading books, papers or articles on relevant technical or professional topics; writing professional papers or articles; studying for actuarial exams; preparing presentations; research or distance learning. Self-study should require a reasonable degree of thought and would exclude "normal" reading such as newspapers, e-mail news updates, internal company memos or process documents. ([source](https://www.soa.org/leadership/current-initiatives/cpd-faqs-section-b.aspx#B14))
* **Structured Credit:** Structured credit involves any learning experience in which there is an opportunity for interaction among participants, or any experience derived from such an interactive learning experience. ...  At least 7.5 units of structured credit each cycle must come from a source other than your employer. The 7.5 units minimum is to ensure that you receive continuing education from sources other than your fellow employees. If your employer sponsors a structured education event where an outside (nonâ€“employee) speaker is present, then that structured education is considered to come from a source other than your employer and counts toward the 7.5 units minimum.
