# People Analytics -- 5/04/2018

HR -- people think it should be relationship driven, get some feedback when it's data driven...
therefore, need to tell good stories with the data

have some questions at the end to guide people where to look next... end with an opportunity for people to contribute, so it's a converstaion, not a lecture

how do you model success?
* grading outcomes, not teams (teams change over time)
* from a scientific perspective, success metrics difficult to define
-- published? yes/no, can take 3 years to publish
-- failure can be useful, too, as you can learn from failed experiments
-- in research: funding is ok

data collected
* performance reviews
* bonuses
* engagement surveys (every 4 months...)
* meta data -- who's talking to who (emails, chats, calenders) -- relationship analysis

People Analytics -- at the end of the day, all about psychology

surveys: not "anonymous" -- confidential (at Fidelity, only 5 people have access to data, not even everyone on HR analytics team)

not able to do A/B testing -- hard to do experiments with your employees
one example: testing effecacy of leadership training programs

text mining: a bit part of HR analytics (text / NLP)
* can be much more valuable than the numbers!
