analytics: disrupting entire industires
healthcare has been a data-driven industry for many years now
docs need to go to school for 20 years... 

insurance as an analytics industry... 
trying to manage risk you take, -> individuals vs pools
change risk you take,           -> understand and intervene
change the administration and cost of administration -> compliance and automation

health care -- intensely personal, data incredibly private, data already exist, just need to be implemented
not predicting, not trying to get people to buy
predicting peoples lives... should take that personally

as we move from consumer to industrial, our stakes change

example: indentifying and predicting diabetes
what's changed: our models are better, faster, cheaper
* faster: don't need a decade of experience--kids out of college are making models more intelligent than the doctors could do...
* actuaries are framing the question backwards (not just AIC > 0.09)

identifying and predicting diabetes
predicting opioid use disorder
* 116 people / day
* use member, coverage, pharmacy claims, facility claims, physician claims -> ML engine

* 10 years experience, build a lot of models
* ML... push up recall/precision -- faster, cheaper sure, but better model too

why use ML / predictive technology?
if we could reach the right people we could
	- ARREST (no...)
	- TREAT instead of enforce (no...)
	- PREVENT instead of treat (yes!) -- THIS IS WHERE THE DISRUPTION IS

ML allows us to solve NEW problems
- problems where there is no SME
- problems where the data is unstructured, text, or image-based

future planning
* need to focus on TEXT
* then move onto images / Keras

going into production, need to monitor...
(DS== need data, skills, infrastructure)
